# Theme

Some custom file for the theme [Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic)
kde theme. Only the modified files are stored in the repo, the rest are simply
fetched in the nix derivation from the repo. Currently we have:

* `./colorschemes/NordicDarker.colors.tmpl`: a template for the colorscheme
  in which the color is replaced by a custom theme color.
* `./layouts`: the desktop layout.
